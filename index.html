<p><main> That's right, this web domain belongs to you. I'm actually pretty jealous your name was available.</p>
<p>Rather than just give you an empty domain, I wanted to make something from scratch that would look nice, which is why I made this website.</p>
<h2 id="ways-to-use-your-new-domain">Ways to Use Your New Domain</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start a blog.</li>
<li>Start a business.</li>
<li>Make a web design/artistic portfolio to show off your work.</li>
<li>Generate as many email addresses as you want, such as: <!-- For the emails below, use javascript 'window.location.hostname' to get the wwww.example.com-->
<ul>
<li>born2Bwild@<span class="example-domain">www.example.com</span></li>
<li>foxy-grandma@<span class="example-domain">www.example.com</span></li>
<li>fortnite.fragger62@<span class="example-domain">www.example.com</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Build a personal website for when you're famous, so your fans can find facts about you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of ourse, I'd be happy to help you get started with any ideas you have.</p>
<h2 id="use-cautiosly">Use Cautiosly!</h2>
<p>Anything attached to this domain, be it a website, email addresses, or anything, is tied to your name. Make sure it's content you actually want the world to know is connected to you. It's best used for professional related content such as what peers, clients, employers, or co-workers will want to see. Don't sign up for some sketchy site using this domain. Don't use this domain to make a webpage where you rant about your attraction to feet or whatever. Use some other domain for that stuff.</p>
<h2 id="this-project-is-open-source">This project is open source</h2>
<p>Even though I listed your domain name a few times, there is actually no personal information about you anywhere in the source code. That's because the source is freely and publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/theTaikun/gift-domain">GitHub</a>. Fork it and modify it if your little heart so desires. To any strangers reading this, if you find any part of this page useful, please feel free to fork it and make it your own.</p>
<h2 id="boring-stuff">Boring stuff</h2>
The content of this page was first made via Markdown. I converted it to HTML and added the CSS. I've been making tweaks here and there, and tracking the versioning using github. </main>
