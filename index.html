<h2 id="and-congratulations-on-your-new-website">And congratulations on your new website :)</h2>
<p>That's right, this web domain belongs to you. I'm actually pretty jealous your name was available.</p>
<p>Rather than just give you an empty domain, I wanted to make something from scratch for you, which is why I made this website.</p>
<h2 id="ways-to-use-your-domain">Ways to use your domain</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start a blog.</li>
<li>Start a business.</li>
<li>Start an web design/artistic portfolio.</li>
<li>Generate as many email addresses as you want such as: <!-- For the emails below, use javascript 'window.location.hostname' to get the wwww.example.com-->
<ul>
<li>born2Bwild@thisdomain.com</li>
<li>foxy-grandma@thisdomain.com</li>
<li>fortnite.fragger71@thisdomain.com</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Of ourse, I'd be happy to help you get started with any ideas you have.</p>

<p>You'll notice that other than the domain, your name is not listed anywhere on this website. That is because the source is made <a href="">publicly available</a>, and I want to protect your identity because I love you &lt;3.</p>
<h3 id="dont-mix-online-identities">Don't mix online identities</h3>
<p>You probably already have several online identities. Maybe you use the same username for fan sites, and a different one for social media. The internet gives the gift of anonimity,and it's important to understand when to use various levels of anonimity.</p>
<p>Because this domain is your name, anything that is attached to it is attached to your most public identity. Only use it for things that you actually want people to know who you are. Don't sign up for some random fan website with it. But do create an email address with it, and use it on a resume.</p>
<h2 id="this-project-is-open-source">This project is open source</h2>
<p>I'll admit, I had selfish motivations for building this site. A lot of the development projects I work on are intended to make money. So I don't have a public portfolio at all.</p>
<p>Usually, with the websites I build, I like throwing in a lot of php and closely tying it to the programming on my server. You'll find none of that here! Just ole' fashion HTML, JS, and CSS. That's because its actually a <a href="">GitHub Page.</a> You can find the source over at <a href="">the repo for this site</a>.</p>
<h2 id="boring-stuff">Boring stuff</h2>
<p>This content of this page was first made via Markdown. I converted it to HTML and added the CSS. I've been making tweaks here and there, and tracking the versioning using github. Typically, I develop on my Gentoo Linux laptop, but because it's a VCS, I can use any computer and submit changes to the same project.</p>
