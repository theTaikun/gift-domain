			<h2>Did I mention this project was open source?</h2>
			<p>You may have noticed this page is pretty simple. There's no database, or fancy php. I haven't even used your name anywhere on this page.</p>
			<p>This is because this project is open source. I wanted to make everything easily available to you, so that you could edit, or reuse it as you see fit. And maybe someone else will use this site to gift to their younger sibling</p>
			<p>Anyway, this project is <a href='https://github.com/theTaikun/gift-domain'>Available on GitHub</a></p>
